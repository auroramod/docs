# Updating IW7-Mod

IW7-Mod has a auto-updater that runs when the client is open. This applies to dedicated servers too to ensure everyone stays up to date and doesn't fall behind.

## Toggling updates off

:::warning
We **do not recommend** turning updates off for IW7-Mod unless you are on your own build and developing.
:::

To turn the auto updater off, add `-noupdate` as a command line parameter passed through to the exe via Command Prompt or a `.bat` file.
