# Fullbright

Fullbright is a feature in H1-Mod and can provide better user experience for low-end users via the `r_fullbright` command.

## Options

1. `r_fullbright 0` disables fullbright. All lights are rendered as normal.
2. `r_fullbright 1` cranks all the lights to 10, making visibility very easy, but also very ugly.
3. `r_fullbright 2` disables all dynamic lighting. Game visuals are mainly unaffected, and this can help with performance on some low-end builds.
