# How to install H1-Mod

## Installing base game files

:::warning

Torrenting copyright protected files might not be legal in your country even if you already own a valid license! We (The H1-Mod Staff and Members) are not responsible for any legal issues, and we highly recommend you to use a fresh install from Steam or the usage of a VPN.

:::

1. Download/Open your torrent client, we recommend using the [qBittorrent Windows Client](https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html) ![](/img/qbittorrent.png)

2. Download and open the torrent file [h1_full_files.torrent](https://h1.gg/h1_full_files.torrent)

3. Once it is open, there will be a dialogue box, where you will be able to specify the saving location. We highly recommend making a separate "Games" folder in order to do this (for example C:\Games)

## "I already have the Steam version" / "I don't have the DLC"

**If you already have the Steam version, you may install the DLCs using our DLC torrent.**

1. Download the DLC torrent [h1_dlc.torrent](https://h1.gg/h1_dlcs.torrent)

2. Extract and place all the DLC files in the root directory of your game. If the dialogue box asks you to merge folders, click "yes to all or Replace file in destination"

## Installing the H1-Mod client

1. Download the latest release from [H1-Mod's Github](https://github.com/h1-mod/h1-mod/releases)
