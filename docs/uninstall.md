# How to uninstall H1-Mod
H1-Mod does not leave many files or traces in your game files. The only directories that are used/created are the game folders themselves and `%localappdata%/auroramod`. 


### Deleting from game files

* Delete h1-mod/iw7-mod.exe and both the **data** & the **h1-mod**/**iw7-mod** folder(s) from your game directory.
