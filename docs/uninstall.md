# How to uninstall H1-Mod

H1-Mod does not leave many files or traces in your game files. The only directories that are used/created are the game folders themselves and `%localappdata%/auroramod`. These files **do not** touch the original game ever and will **not** get you banned from the original version of the game.

### Deleting from game files

* Delete `h1-mod` and both the `data` & the `h1-mod` folder(s) from your game directory.
* Delete `usermaps` and `mods` if present
