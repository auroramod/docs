## Downloading

### Through Steam

1. If you own the game on Steam, you can download the language through it.

2. If you don't own the DLCs, you can download the missing files through [Mega.nz](#through-meganz) or [mirrors](#through-mirrors).

### Through Mega.nz

1. Download your language pack from [Mega.nz folder](https://mega.nz/folder/OTBWWAqY#KNyc53z1JPNUUWCS4qVqlQ).
    - There's 3 options, downloading the ``full language folder``, ``without soundfiles`` and ``only DLC map``. 
    - We recommend download the ``full language pack`` (~1GB) to get the original experience without any issues.

### Through mirrors
1. [https://h1.jokeruarwentto.tk/](https://h1.jokeruarwentto.tk/)
    - Hosted in France, can be slow and full language pack only.
