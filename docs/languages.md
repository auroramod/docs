## Downloading from Steam

If you own the game on Steam, you can download the language pack needed for the game.

## Downloading from MEGA

You can also download your language pack from our files on [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/OTBWWAqY#KNyc53z1JPNUUWCS4qVqlQ).

:::info

There are 3 download options available. You can download the `Full '*language*' folder`, `*language* without soundfiles` and `*language* but only DLC maps`. We recommend downloading the full language files to get the original experience without experiencing any issues. To download, right click on the folder you choose, go to the Download tab, and Download as Zip.

## Installation

:::warning

If you have downloaded the game from Steam, you might not have the `zone` folder present. We highly recommend you to use [MWR Files Cleaner](https://github.com/skkuull/mwr-files-cleaner) to get better directory structures.

1. Navigate to your MWR game folder and find your `zone` directory. Once there, create a new folder with the language name you are using (look below for reference).

   - French: `french`
   - German: `german`
   - Italian: `italian`
   - Japanese: `japanese_partial`
   - Korean: `korean`
   - Polish: `polish`
   - Portuguese: `portuguese`
   - Russian: `russian`
   - Simplified Chinese: `simplified_chinese`
   - Spanish: `spanish`
   - Traditional Chinese: `traditional_chinese`

2. Once in your new folder, extract the content of the `.zip` file you have downloaded.

   - If you already have your language's folder, just extract it in `zone` directory.

3. Verify if your extracting was done successfully (see below).

## Switching

1. Once you are ingame, open the `Options` menu, and then you should see a `Language` button. This will redirect you to a menu that will switch your language.

2. Select your desired language and then restart your game.
   - If your language button is missing or grayed out, then it isn't installed correctly.
