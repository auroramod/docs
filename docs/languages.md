## Downloading from Steam

If you own the game on Steam, you can download the language pack needed for the game.
1. Right click on the MWR game
2. Select `Properties...`
3. Go to the `Choose Language` tab, and select the language you wish to use from the drop-down menu.

## Installation

:::warning

If you have downloaded the game from Steam, you might not have the `zone` folder present in your files. We highly recommend you to use [MWR Files Cleaner](https://github.com/skkuull/mwr-files-cleaner) to get better directory structures that are easier to work with.

1. Navigate to your MWR game folder and find your `zone` directory. Once there, create a new folder with the language name you are using.
   - French: `french`
   - German: `german`
   - Italian: `italian`
   - Japanese: `japanese_partial`
   - Korean: `korean`
   - Polish: `polish`
   - Portuguese: `portuguese`
   - Russian: `russian`
   - Simplified Chinese: `simplified_chinese`
   - Spanish: `spanish`
   - Traditional Chinese: `traditional_chinese`

2. Once new folder is created, open the folder and extract the content of the `.zip` file you have downloaded.

Once done, verify your language folder looks similar to this.

## Switching

1. Once you are in-game, open the `Options` menu, and then you should see a `Choose Language` button. This will redirect you to a menu that will switch your language.

2. Select your desired language.
   - If your language button is missing, then the language isn't installed correctly.
