## Downloading from Steam

If you own the game on Steam, you can download the language pack needed for the game.
1. Right click on the MWR game
2. Select `Properties...`
3. Go to the `Choose Language` tab, and select the language you wish to use from the drop-down menu.

## Downloading from MEGA

You can also download your language pack from our files on [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/OTBWWAqY#KNyc53z1JPNUUWCS4qVqlQ).

:::info

There are 3 download options available. You can download the `Full '<language>' folder`, `<language> but without soundfiles`, or `*language* but only DLC maps`. We recommend downloading the full language folder to get the original and best experience without any issues. To download, right click on the folder you want, go to the Download tab, and Download as ZIP.

## Installation

:::warning

If you have downloaded the game from Steam, you might not have the `zone` folder present in your files. We highly recommend you to use [MWR Files Cleaner](https://github.com/skkuull/mwr-files-cleaner) to get better directory structures that are easier to work with.

1. Navigate to your MWR game folder and find your `zone` directory. Once there, create a new folder with the language name you are using.
   - French: `french`
   - German: `german`
   - Italian: `italian`
   - Japanese: `japanese_partial`
   - Korean: `korean`
   - Polish: `polish`
   - Portuguese: `portuguese`
   - Russian: `russian`
   - Simplified Chinese: `simplified_chinese`
   - Spanish: `spanish`
   - Traditional Chinese: `traditional_chinese`

2. Once new folder is created, open the folder and extract the content of the `.zip` file you have downloaded.

Once done, verify your language folder looks similar to this.

## Switching

1. Once you are in-game, open the `Options` menu, and then you should see a `Choose Language` button. This will redirect you to a menu that will switch your language.

2. Select your desired language.
   - If your language button is missing, then the language isn't installed correctly.
