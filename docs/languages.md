## Downloading

### From Steam

If you own the game on Steam, you can download the language through it, if you don't own the DLCs, you can download the missing files through [Mega.nz](#from-mega) or [mirrors](#from-mirrors).

### From MEGA

Download your language pack from [Mega.nz folder](https://mega.nz/folder/OTBWWAqY#KNyc53z1JPNUUWCS4qVqlQ).

:::info

There's 3 download options, you can download the `full language directory`, `without soundfiles` and `only DLC maps`. We recommend yourselves to download the full one (`file size around 1 GB`) to get the original experience without experimenting any issues.

### From mirrors

- [https://h1.jokeruarwentto.tk/](https://h1.jokeruarwentto.tk/)
  - Hosted in France, can be slow and full language pack only.

## Installation

:::warning

If you have downloaded the game from Steam, you should not have the `zone` folder, we are highly recommend you to use [cleanup.exe](#) to get correct directory structures.

1. Navigate to Modern Warfare Remastered game folder and find your zone directory. Once there, create a new folder with the language name you are using (look below for reference).

   - French `french`
   - German `german`
   - Italian `italian`
   - Japanese `japanese_partial`
   - Korean `korean`
   - Polish `polish`
   - Portuguese `portuguese`
   - Russian `russian`
   - Simplified Chinese `simplified_chinese`
   - Spanish `spanish`
   - Traditional Chinese `traditional_chinese`

2. Once in your new folder, extract the content of the `.zip` file you have downloaded.

   - If you already have your language's folder, just extract it in `zone` directory.

3. Verify if your extracting was done successfully.

2. Select the wanted language, and restart your game.
   - If your language button is missing, then you've badly installed it.
