# Welcome 👋

**Aurora's** official documentation has guides for downloading, fixing errors, modding the game, and more!

## What is Aurora?

Aurora is the official team of people behind **H1-Mod**, a previously released client. When IW7-Mod was planned to be released eventually, we had rebranded from the specific **H1-Mod** alias to support multiple games for the feature. We are a small team of 7 people who mod these games in our free time.

## What is H1-Mod?

**H1-Mod** is a modded client for *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered.* The client aims to provide a better-than-vanilla experience, with many quality-of-life features added to the experience. The original game on Steam never had a huge player base, and is considered a forgotten Call of Duty. The original game on Steam also has so many game breaking features that it is hard to play the original experience without facing a issue every so often.

With H1-Mod, you can have a unlocked field of view adjustment, HUD safe area adjustment, detailed sensitivity adjustment, multiple fullbright modes, disabling of broken shader caching, unlocking all cosmetics, stat changing, uncapped max FPS, a dedicated server browser, custom weapons and maps, and more.

## What is IW7-Mod?

**IW7-Mod** is a modded client for *Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.* The client adds many of the quality-of-life features that *H1-Mod* also features. The main purpose of this client is to add extended modding support, like custom fastfiles including weapons/models, a overall better GSC development experience, a emulated marketplace system, a server browser, and much more!
