# GSC dumps

A GSC dump contains the gameplay scripting to bring the ingame experience together. While H1 GSC is completely researched, IW7 GSC is about 75-80% researched as many things in Infinite Warfare are simply new or unresearched.

## H1 

:::tip
H1 is heavily based off IW6 (Ghosts), so the GSC remains the same in many areas. You can use the **[IW6 Developer GSC Dump](https://github.com/mjkzy/iw6-gsc-dump)** that contains developer comments and names for functions, variables, etc.

## IW7

:::warning
**IW7 GSC is not entirely researched.** While IW7 is a successor to IW6 (Ghosts) and some remains similar, the entire GSC codebase was changed, as well as the naming standard. Using both the **[IW6 Developer GSC Dump](https://github.com/mjkzy/iw6-gsc-dump)** and **[IW8 Developer GSC Dump](https://github.com/hc20k/iw8-rawfiles/tree/main/scripts)** can greatly help.
