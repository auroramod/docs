# Common Issues

## "My game won't open for some reason?"

- Download and run [Chase's Redist Installer](https://chse.dev/redists) for Visual Studio C++ redists. **This is safe to do.**
- Try updating your GPU drivers or any other outdated drivers.
- Make sure you don't have MSI Afterburner or a overlay trying to open your game.
- Make sure you don't have a weird anti-virus like Avast or McAfee from preventing the game from opening.

## Verify game files (Steam version)

1. Go to Steam, and navigate to your Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered installation.
2. Right click on the installed game, and click "Properties"
3. In the "Local Files" tab, press **"Verify integrity of game files"**.
4. Once it is done, you may start H1-Mod again and see if it launches.

## "I get a black screen when trying to load some maps"

You don't have the DLC maps installed. We recommend buying the game DLCs from Steam for no issues.

## "My HUD and hitmarkers are desynchronized from the gameplay"

Stop using the jitter mod you have, and it will fix itself. Same goes for open scroll wheel exploits.

## "The launcher splash screen doesn't respond and eventually closes"

Anti-viruses like Avast or McAfee can throw H1-Mod into a sleep loop and the game will refuse to open. You need to **completely uninstall the anti-virus** or find a way to stop it from interfering with processes.
