# PS5 controller

COD:MWR already has native controller support for both Xbox (XInput) and PS4 controllers. Aim assist is natively *on by default* once you plug in a controller. The only popular controller that **does not fall in this category is the PlayStation 5 controller**. You will need to use a tool called [DS4Windows](https://docs.ds4windows.app/) in order to get the game to recognize it, which will show in-game buttons as the PS4 controller.
